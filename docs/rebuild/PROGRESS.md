# Rebuild progress

## Current state (2026-11-09)

WF1 is complete. Fireweed applied and archived both changes after separate
audits with no findings and passing implementation verification:

- [0195-run-argv-contract](../../changes/archive/0195-run-argv-contract.md)
  (`eb4a7f2`) documents `gitstore.Request.Args[0]` as the executable and
  adds regression coverage. All 925 cases passed.
- [0196-drill-self-checked-reconstruction](../../changes/archive/0196-drill-self-checked-reconstruction.md)
  (`084fbd4`) gives the drill worker a buildable input workspace with
  dependency implementations and its own eval hook. All 485 cases passed.

Fireweed released both claims after applying the changes.

WF2 is complete. `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...` and `fireweed ci` passed
on the WF2 controller source commit `6cc2629`. The first Go test run alongside CI
failed a timed app eval, which passed on the standalone retry. CI ran with
Doctor enabled in a temporary local clone over `65bf933..6cc2629`.

WF3 is complete. With owner approval, the recorded controller ran
`fireweed drill workflow` once at `4754026` with the configured Codex worker.
The drill passed after its configured retry. All 666 cases passed (181
workflow, 323 app, 162 runner) and the worker reported no contradicted
Decisions. Fireweed cleaned up the scratch worktree and retained reconstruction
`38aa8fc` under `refs/fireweed/drills/workflow/20261109T224519.080152000`.
The [native report](../../.fireweed/drills/workflow.md) is committed in `c62b5be`.

WF4 is complete. The owner reviewed the report and approved these dispositions:

- **FLOW-110 / APP-126.** Closed. APP-126 specifies P01 for an unavailable
  base and its eval passed on the drill retry.
- **FLOW-052 / checks.** Deferred raw boundary-hook output retention. The
  current boundary API returns diagnostics only.
- **FLOW-027 / checks.** Fireweed applied and archived
  [0197-boundary-hook-nonzero-exit](../../changes/archive/0197-boundary-hook-nonzero-exit.md)
  in `d45652a`. CHK-043 now rejects a nonzero exit without a module-attributed
  violation. Both regressions failed first, the separate audit found no
  gaps, and all 787 implementation cases passed. `fireweed check` and
  `fireweed check-commits a0e25a2..d45652a` passed. The queue is empty and
  Fireweed released the claim.

The owner approved the `0197` worker and restricted audit contexts for OpenAI
Codex and granted standing authorization for the configured change lifecycle.
[SYSTEM.md](../../SYSTEM.md#agent-configuration) records the scope and destination.

## Controller and candidate

The installed `.fireweed/bin/fireweed` was rebuilt with `-trimpath` from clean
main with an empty queue and no claims. Go build metadata confirms the
revision and a clean source tree.

Controller source: `e1e1869131833778f1f8f1a23cf62b0d3b3869b3`

With `GOCACHE=/tmp/fireweed-rebuild-cache`, the fresh macOS arm64 candidate
clone passed the product build, `go test ./...`,
`go test -race ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `fireweed check`, and standalone
`fireweed doctor` including canaries, recovery and both agent probes.
`fireweed check-commits` passed 1,304 commits over
`be35552b706aa3000ff8f11306d129ff1d701b85..e1e1869131833778f1f8f1a23cf62b0d3b3869b3`.
CI with Doctor enabled over the same range passed on the full retry. CI
verified passing evals and coverage for app, assets, checks, contracts,
gitstore, project, runner and workflow. The first CI run failed on the
deadline-sensitive `Test_RUN_036_RUN_037_OneBudgetAcrossChangesRetainsApplied`
eval, which passed in isolation before the full retry.

## Drill proof inventory

**Contracts renewed, awaiting owner review.** The verified controller ran
`fireweed drill contracts` at `e7f1554`. All 1,119 cases passed on the first
attempt, including 64 contracts cases and 1,055 transitive dependent cases.
The [native report](../../.fireweed/drills/contracts.md) is committed in
`24f9d94`. Fireweed cleaned up both scratch locations and retained
`30c7cdfd356d7068f841179c9c4a1fb1321be6c4` at
`refs/fireweed/drills/contracts/20261110T034341.899515000`.
The proof changes only disposable contracts paths.

The report lists no contradicted Decisions and three questions for review:

- `CON-002` / `CON-009` leave fenced headings and level-one section boundaries
  implicit. The reconstruction handles these differently from the current code.
- `CON-008` leaves equality for YAML NaN and offset timestamp keys ambiguous.
- `CON-017` through `CON-019` specify codes and, for duplicates, a subject.
  The evals also pin error wording or prefixes.

**Reuse workflow.** The retained ref and commit `38aa8fc` match the committed
passing report and change only workflow's disposable files. Since that report,
`0197` changed the checks dependency. The retained workflow reconstruction
passed the `FLOW-027` and `FLOW-062` evals and the app CI boundary-failure eval
against the current candidate in a temporary clone.

**Renew the four remaining missing proofs.** The prior passing reports are committed.
The following refs under `refs/fireweed/drills/<module>/` are absent from this
checkout and GitHub origin advertises none. Their exact commits were unavailable
across 119 local object stores, including the historical candidate directories.

| Module | Ref suffix | Expected commit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gitstore | `20261101T170411.628421000` | `3cdc945cea3923dd22877e56e9a570f7a3caf346` |
| assets | `20261101T173119.320562000` | `53ed45d3ee36dcac05fc5b736fa461152dd011d4` |
| project | `20261102T031647.104747000` | `481bc00c1da360d3e8bf76cd5ba04053d2dccaeb` |
| checks | `20261107T002339.020159000` | `c0ca0397e3781410e795f27b52de2b2105350559` |

Reassess reuse if an exact historical proof is recovered from a backup.
Checks needs current proof of the `0197` CHK-043 change. `runner` and `app`
need first native reports and retained refs.

## Next step

Review the contracts report and its three questions with the owner. Start
`gitstore` after the owner's instruction to continue the [regeneration goal](GOAL.md).
The remaining order is `gitstore`, `assets`, `project`, `checks`, `runner`,
then `app`.

Deadline set by the owner: **2026-11-10 22:51:05 UTC**.
