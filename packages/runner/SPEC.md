# runner

## Specs

### RUN-001
InvokeAgent MUST select agent.command for the worker role and audit.command for the audit role, falling back to agent.command when audit.command is unset.

### RUN-002
InvokeAgent MUST run the selected command from Snapshot.Root.

### RUN-003
InvokeAgent MUST expand {prompt} and {git_common_dir} once in command templates and wrapper argv. Commands MUST accept shell strings or argv, quoting shell substitutions and preserving argv values literally.

### RUN-004
InvokeAgent MUST prepend the configured agent.wrap argv prefix for both worker and audit commands.

### RUN-005
InvokeAgent MUST set the command's FIREWEED_BIN environment variable to the request Bin.

### RUN-006
InvokeAgent MUST retain the command's stdout, stderr and exit code in AgentResult.

### RUN-007
InvokeAgent MUST use a positive request Timeout in preference to the configured timeout, using the configured timeout when the request is unset. It MUST stop the command's process group when that bound expires or its context is cancelled.

### RUN-008
InvokeAgent MUST set UsageLimit true exactly when a nonzero command exit has a configured limit_patterns match in its final 20 output lines.

### RUN-009
InvokeAgent MUST return command-launch, timeout or cancellation errors without discarding captured output.

## Decisions

[0075-bounded-agent-invocation] An unset configured timeout defaults to 90 minutes. limit_patterns are
case-insensitive literal substrings, using the final 20 lines of stdout followed
by stderr with terminal newline separators trimmed.
